watchlist functionality:
what makes up a watchlist:
watchlist name
list of items:
	icon image
	item name
	Cost To Craft
	adj b/s
	adj c/s
How to store watchlists:
ctc,adj b/s, and adjc/s are dynamic values, no point in storing them
icon image should be stored in the item database, another column will have to
be added.
wathlists technically should be able to ahve the same name, therefolre a
watchlist id will have to be added

watchlsits will be stored in a json file in the data dir, watchlist.json
anytime a watchlist change event occurs, the ui will alert the watchlist
managing class of the event and that class will write to disk.

watchlist managing class:
loads the json file at initialization, or creates it if it does not
exist
once the watchlist is loaded, it will check the item db if we have downlaoded
its icon before, if not, it will call a database method (maybe called
downloadImade(qint32 itemID): sotres the blob data, returns the pixelmap?)
a nested class in the managing class will handle a single instance of a
watchlist and the containing item info.
this class will contain the recipetree, as well as the helper methods to
provide the appropriate data structures to the UI to display the tree
structures.
 
the watchlsit managing object will contain a hashmap where the key is thge
watchlistID and the value is the previously watchlist object.

adding watchlists:

after some research into the qt ui docs, new way to set this up:
each watchlist will be a QWidget object, loads the base Ui form on creation
the main window new tab event will call a method in the watchlist managing
class that will return a reference to that newly made qwidget
the managing class is not responsible for interacting directly with those
qwidgets, only for storing them in memory, and reading/writing from disk.
the managing class will be composed in the main class

WatchListTabManager:
public:
constructor: load json data into memory
destructor: writes json
QList<WatchListTabWidget*> get(): returns a list of watchlist references that
the main class can use to insert into the tab widget
private:
QList<std::shared_ptr<WatchListTabWidget>> watchListTabList;
read(): clears the watchlisttablist and reads the json file
write(): writes the watchlist list name and item names to the json file
NOTE: will a watchlist id be necessary? order should be preserved without
needing ids

WatchListTabWidget:
constructor: takes a watchlist name and a list of item ids, uses the id to
fetch the necessary data from the other program modules
