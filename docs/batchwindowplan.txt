Following the UI setup in uimockup2.png, there will be three main sections in
the window.

Watchlist Items:
-A table of 3 columns, Item Name, Craft Cost, and # Crafts
Note: a fourth column may be necessary for an integer spinner to change the
quantity desired of the items
-Similar right click menu to the watchlist tab that can remove entries from the
table.

Shopping List:
-Table containing the columns: Item Name, Amount, Price. Is filled in according 
to the contents in the watchlsit items table, and adjusts to changes in that table.
-A secondary, smaller table should be beneath for overflow items with columns: Item Name, Parent Item, Amount, Cost, Profit. This amount of detail might not be needed.

Commit Window:
Clarification on this window is needed from Calvin. Contains the estimated
total cost and profit from the entire batch, the commit button commits to 
local history db? I predict the alpha features of the program will stop there,
and the planned Transaction API features integreated with this button.
