-Set row height on tables to minimum to save space
-Add text notation to crafting tree table to show that an item does not have to be bought or crafted
-Loading screen
-Crash when adding another item before the first is done loading
-(FIXED) Setting a quantity to zero in the batch window adds that product to the shopping list with a quantity of a zero
